			<Note Type="Changed" Details="Updated third party components." />
			<Note Type="Fixed" Details="Searching binary files would miss matches if the characters immediately before the match were themselves a partial match, e.g. searching for &quot;test&quot; would not have matched with &quot;tetest&quot; in a binary file.

		<ProductVersion Number="1.36" Date="2023-05-18" IsLive="true">
			<Note Type="New" Details="Added a new binary file viewer. The old viewer was a Winforms control hosted in the WPF application and would fail to display correctly for some users.

		</ProductVersion>
		<ProductVersion Number="1.28" Date="2021-05-18" IsLive="true">
			<Note Type="New" Details="Added support for searching Microsoft Office Open Xml documents (.docx, .pptx and .xlsx files). Readable text is extracted from these files, then searched and displayed as plain text in Grind. Because of the extra processing, searching Office files is considerably slower than searching plain text files. Replace is not supported for these file types. For Word documents, all text is extracted. For Excel, the data includes populated cell references, cell formulas and cell values, arranged by worksheets. For PowerPoint, the data includes all text elements, arranged by slides. To search Office files make sure &quot;search office files&quot; is ticked. See the [HELP#msofficefiles] for more details." />

		</ProductVersion>
		<ProductVersion Number="1.18" Date="2019-10-08" IsLive="true">
			<Note Type="New" Details="Added &quot;search same files&quot; option, which skips the file finding stage and re-searches the same files as the last search found, cutting a lot of time from a full search. By default searching will switch to this mode whenever possible (e.g. when searching the same folder multiple times, ctrl+click searching, and navigating through the search history). This behaviour can be disabled in Options &gt; Search &gt; Scope. The downside of searching the same files is that files added since the initial search will not be included - switch back to &quot;search folder&quot; if files have been added that you want to search." />
			<Note Type="Changed" Details="Improved whole word matching for non-regex searches. Will now match non-word characters at the start and end of search text. For example, whole word searches for &quot;item.&quot; will now match &quot;item.value&quot;, and &quot;(int&quot; will now match &quot;action(int x)&quot;. This matches the behaviour of regex searches, as well as applications like Visual Studio and Notepad++." />

			<Note Type="Changed" Details="Improved the handling of large files.&lt;br/&gt;
			                              The text viewer now reports when files are too large to display instead of just crashing. The text viewer has to load the entire file before it can be displayed, which restricts the size of files it can display. The largest text file successfully searched and displayed on 64-bit Windows was 900MB (which took 15 seconds to search for a three character match, and another 30 seconds to load and display the contents). Larger files will be searched, but not displayed in Grind.&lt;br/&gt;
			                              The binary viewer pages the file into memory as you scroll, so it can display much larger files.
